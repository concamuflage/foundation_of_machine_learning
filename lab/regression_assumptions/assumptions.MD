four assumptions

1 y and each predictor is linearly related
2 samples are random
3 errors at each x form a normal distribution
4 all normal distributions have the same sigma. 

resources:
Good explantion for residual plot. 
It seems most vids use x in the x-axis instead of. 
What if the model uses two predictors? use y on the x-axis!
