This plot checks linearity and constant variance (homoscedasticity).

What you see:
	•	The residuals (points) clearly form a U-shaped curve.
	•	They are not randomly scattered around the red horizontal line (residual = 0).
	•	At higher fitted values, the spread of residuals increases.

What it means:
	•	❌ Linearity is violated:
The U-shape suggests the true relationship between x and y is nonlinear — the linear model cannot capture the curvature.
	•	❌ Constant variance is violated (heteroscedasticity):
The residual spread increases with fitted values — variance is not constant.
