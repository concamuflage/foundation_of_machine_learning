graph interpretation:

the yellow vertical  line is the variance of population.
the red vertical  line is the average of variances(divide by n) in samples
the blue vertical  line is the average of variances(divide by n-1) in samples

the blueline is closer the yellowline - this demonstrates
that the average of variance is closer to the true population variance.

that is why we use bessel's correction.


red (color is bit different because of opacity)histogram centers left of the true variance -- underestimate.
blue (color is bit different because of opacity) histogram centers around the true variance.
