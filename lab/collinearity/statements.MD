This lab is to test the following conclusions.
    
    •	When two or more independent variables are highly correlated, entering both of them into a multiple linear regression model may be problematic as the effect of each may cancel the other out.
	•	This phenomenon is called collinearity or multicollinearity.
Multicollinearity increases the standard errors of the coefficients.
	•	Increased SE means some regression coefficients are close to 0.
Multicollinearity makes some variables statistically insignificant when they should be significant.
