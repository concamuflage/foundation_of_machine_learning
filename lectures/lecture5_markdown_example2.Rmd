## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r cars, echo =TRUE}
library(ISLR)
summary(Hitters)   # Data of baseball players, including Salary which we try to predict here.
summary(cars)
```
## Three options
- echo = FALSE/TRUE - show the code
- eval = FALSE/TRUE - show the results of the code
- include = FALSE/TRUE - show the code and the results

# Header
## Header 2
### Header 3


**bold with two space/next line**  
__bold__  
*italic*  

![]() include whatever inside the prenteses to the backet like a picture or hyperlink

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

```

add code - choose "insert chunk" from "code" tab at the menu

```{r}

```

commets here

```{r setup2, include=FALSE}
Hitters = na.omit(Hitters)
with(Hitters, sum(is.na(Salary)))
```
Best Subset Regression.
Using "leaps" library.

```{r pressure0, echo=FALSE}
library(leaps)
regfit_full = regsubsets(Salary ~ . , data = Hitters) 
summary(regfit_full)
```
By default goes to the subset of size 8
Let us increase that to 19 - all the variables.


```{r pressure2, echo=FALSE}
regfit_full = regsubsets(Salary ~ . , data = Hitters , nvmax=19) 
reg.summary = summary(regfit_full)
names(reg.summary)          #Get names of the object
plot(reg.summary$cp , xlab="Number of Variables" , ylab = "Cp")
which.min(reg.summary$cp)
```


```{r pressure3, echo=FALSE}
plot(regfit_full , scale= "Cp")
coef(regfit_full , 10)
```
