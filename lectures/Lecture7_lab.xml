  Predict the insurance charges as a function of age, sex, region, body mass index, number of children and smoking status.

  You can use multiple linear regression to find out if there’s an association between dependent and independent variables in this model.
  You can also use one-way analysis of variance to compare group means.

Data Description:
Medical Cost Personal Dataset

The dataset that we will analyze in this assignment is dataset that describes medical costs of people in the US based on the following factors:

Age - age of primary beneficiary
BMI – insurance contractor gender – female or male
Children – number of children covered by health insurance
Smoker – smoking status – yes or no
Region – beneficiary’s residential area in the US – northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest
Charges – individual medical costs billed by health insurance

The dataset has been loaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance
and reduced to 500 participants.


Questions:
- Calculate the least squares regression equation that predicts insurance charges from age.
- Then, separate simple linear regression that calculates charges from bmi.
- Calculate the least square regression that predicts insurance charges from age and bmi.
- Formally test whether age is a predictor associated with insurance charges at the alpha = 0.05 level.
